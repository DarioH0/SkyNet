The SkyNet Terminal is a simple terminal made in Go. It provides a set of commands that perform various actions like displaying the current directory, hosting a file, and more. The terminal is easy to use, providing clear and concise output. The error handling system works by checking for errors after each command execution, and printing an error message in the event of an error. The error messages are displayed in red text to distinguish them from other output. The terminal also provides a help command to display information about each command.
